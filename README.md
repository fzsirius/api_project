# Song Lyrics Analyzer API

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to create an API that allows users to search for song lyrics and analyze the text within those lyrics. This API integrates two external APIs: the Genius API for fetching song lyrics and the TextRazor API for text analysis.

When a user searches for the lyrics of a song, the API fetches the lyrics using the Genius API. It then passes the lyrics to the TextRazor API, which classifies the entities within the text. Entities can include characters mentioned in the lyrics, places, and more. This could help users analyze the underlying meanings and themes in a song's lyrics.

This project is in its early stages. The current focus is on setting up the server, installing necessary dependencies, and configuring the Genius and TextRazor APIs. Future updates will include the implementation of the search and analysis functionalities, error handling, and more.
